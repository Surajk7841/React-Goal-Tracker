## Description 

Description: "React Goal Tracker" is a straightforward and user-friendly web application designed to help you keep your goals organized and on track. The minimalistic UI features a single input field for adding course goals, which will turn red and highlight the input field's background if you attempt to submit without entering valid data, providing clear feedback. Once you enter a valid goal, it is displayed in a list below the input field, allowing you to easily manage multiple goals. The initial goals, "Do all exercises!" and "Finish the course!", are pre-added for your convenience and can be deleted with a simple click. This project simplifies the process of setting and managing your goals, ensuring a focused and productive approach to your tasks.
